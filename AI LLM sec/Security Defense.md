- **Unique Challenges:**
	- Probabilistic System
	- Dynamic Data Handling & real time interactions
	- Black Box
	- Separation of trusted & untrusted input

---

- **Mitigation:**
	- Roust Input Validation:
		- Separate trusted & untrusted data
		- Strict controls on Training data 
			- Update training data
		- Strict data access controls
			- Separate sensitive data from system prompts.
	
	- Output Handling:
		- Output Filtering
		- Fact-checking
			- Variable usage
		- Action:
			- Human in the middle
	
	- IAM:
		- Principle of Least Privilege (RBAC)
		- Authentication, Authorization & Access Control
		- RBAC, MFA, SSO, IdP

	- Continuous Process:
		- Monitor & Log
			- Anomaly Detection
		- Security Audits
		- Regular security patches
		- Threat Intelligence

	- Defense in Depth:
		- Data Encryption
		- Containing the attack
			- Network Segmentation
			- Container security
	
	- Security:
		- Security Policies & Standards
		- Deterministic Security
