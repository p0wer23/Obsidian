*Learning must build on itself
    PERRIO: priming, encoding, reference, retrieval & interleaving, overlapping
   Structure, concepts, details

-Train deep processing 
-Think in systems not techniques 
-Test yourself earlier & more often
  --at each level of knowledge 
  --in different ways
-Assume you will make every mistake again
-Do spaced repetition & active recall properly 
-Rote memorize but only as last resort
  --flash cards, memory palaces, link methods 
-study with friends sometimes
  --model questions & answers
-study ahead to get ahead
-scope every subject to 10x your efficiency 
-use cognizant load to delete passive learning 
-Create analogies 
  --critique analogies 
-Keep a learning log
